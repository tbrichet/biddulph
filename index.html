    <!--About-->
    <div id="about">
        <h2>About</h2>
        <p>In 1922, in the San Joaquin Valley of California, H.K. Biddulph was teaching the “Greatest Generation” in the years leading up to World War II.  In 2022, we his descendants will be facing our own opportunities to impact a generation. How can we honor such a legacy and support one another for the future?</p>
        <p>Several of us have gotten together over the last few months to come up with a plan for a family reunion that we hope everyone will have the opportunity to attend. We’ve been thinking and talking about getting a reunion together for a quite a while. It’s probably now time, as it’s been over 25 years since our last family get-together.</p>
        <p>In that period, HK’s children have all passed away, with the exception of Lois Biddulph Ogan, and gathering now would provide an opportunity to connect with that generation. This reunion is a way to honor our heritage, encourage one another, and have some fun. </p>
        <p>Thank you so much for the feedback we received earlier by text and telephone. We are still collecting email addresses and trying to locate some family members like Simone, Dana Biddulph and his sister Deanna. It would be very beneficial for a representative from each of the seven HK Biddulph children’s families to encourage your family members to participate and let us know who will be coming. Also, we would like to re-compile a descendant chart (last one done was in 1995), so additional information is needed – spouses, name changes due to marriage and so on, children, grandchildren, great grandchildren and their dates of birth. You can include this information when you RSVP.</p>

        <p>In order to allow quality time for mingling and to make the trip enjoyable for families who are traveling quite a distance, we thought it would be good to reserve several nights at the Hyatt Regency Resort in Scottsdale. They offer several fun amenities: pools, waterpark, tennis courts, golf, and a spa. Families would be responsible for paying the resort for their rooms. The cost per night will be $399 per room (including resort fees/access to all amenities). The hotel will honor the room rates a few days before and after the reunion. </p>
        <p>We recognize this cost is steep for some, but the standard rate for all these amenities exceeds $700 per night. Some financial assistance can be made available for those who have the need. Reunion meals on Saturday and Sunday will be an additional cost, details to follow.</p>
        <p>We greatly encourage even the residents in Arizona to join in the stay at the resort as this will be the main hub of activity </p>
        <p>We would like to have time for a HUGE group photo (possibly over 150 people!) on Saturday at 5:30 p.m. before dinner. After dinner, families will have the opportunity to share about their family and show pictures by power point. More details will follow. </p>
